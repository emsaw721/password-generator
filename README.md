## Password Generator 


## Description
<a href="https://emsaw721.github.io/password-generator/"> Password generator </a> is an application that allows the user to generate a password based on the parameters given. 

## Usage
The password generator provides a password with at least 8 characters, but up to 128 characters. These characters include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  

At first, the application user will see the opening page.

Then, the user will click the red "Generate Password" button. 
This will propt the app to ask how many characters the user wants their password to contain.
